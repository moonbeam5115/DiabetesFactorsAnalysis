# An Analysis on the Relationships between Behavioral/Physiological Factors and Diabetes

I have an interest in sports, nutrition, and how to maintain certain habits in order to increase athletic performance and overall bodily health. I also have family members who suffer from diabetes and want to be able to better inform them about how to manage their blood sugar. In this analysis, I dive into a few factors that I believe would have an impact on diabetes prevalence in the United States. My goal is to stimulate further curiosity and investigation into the factors that have the most impact on diabetes. 

* In 2018, 34.2 million Americans, or 10.5% of the population, had diabetes
* The estimated total economic cost of diagnosed diabetes in 2012 is $245 billion, a 41% increase from our previous estimate of $174 billion (in 2007 dollars)
* Exercise helped to lower insulin resistance in previously sedentary older adults with abdominal obesity at risk for diabetes (Resistance training and aerobic) - Harvard Study
* Cross sectional, prospective and retrospective studies have found significant association between physical inactivity and Type 2 Diabetes

* More studies should be conducted to analyze the impact of lifestyle on type 2 Diabetes: Exercise, Sleep, Nutrition, Stress Levels, Drug Use
* Exercise can lower insulin resistance and should be incorporated into a holistic treatment for people suffering from diabetes
* Although the relationship between nutrition and diabetes is complex, the most harmful products to consume are carbonated beverages
* Other factors like lack of sleep seem to have a high correlation with diabetes incidence - why?

# Next Steps
* Gather more accurate information about lifestyle choices

* Gather information about economic burden due to diabetes

* Figure out what kind of effect exercise and better nutrition would have on diabetes related healthcare costs

* Adjust the analysis to include the population size
